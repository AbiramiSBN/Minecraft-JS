Below is a proposed **README.md** for the [Minecraft-JS](https://github.com/AbiramiSBN/Minecraft-JS) repository, generated from the observed project structure and build configuration:

Based on the repository's file listing, it comprises three primary folders—`src`, `shaders`, and `server`—alongside the configuration files `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` at the root ([GitHub][1]).
The `webpack.config.js` defines an entry point at `src/main.js`, uses `html-webpack-plugin` to generate the HTML file, and configures a development server with hot reloading and support for loading GLSL shader files via `glsl-shader-loader` ([GitHub][2]).
There is currently no license file in the repository, so you may wish to add an appropriate license (e.g., MIT) to clarify usage rights ([GitHub][1]).

# Minecraft-JS

A browser-based voxel game inspired by Minecraft, built with JavaScript and WebGL shaders, bundled via Webpack and optionally served by a Node.js backend.

## Features

- **Voxel Rendering**: Render a block-based world using custom GLSL shaders.  
- **Live Development**: Built-in dev server with Hot Module Replacement for rapid iteration.  
- **Modular Shaders**: All shader code lives in the `shaders/` directory for easy editing and experimentation.  
- **Node.js Server**: Optional server-side code in `server/` for hosting assets or multiplayer logic.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 14  
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbiramiSBN/Minecraft-JS.git
cd Minecraft-JS
npm install
````

### Running in Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Webpack dev server (configured in `webpack.config.js`), open the game in your browser, and enable live reloading.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be placed in the `dist/` directory.
